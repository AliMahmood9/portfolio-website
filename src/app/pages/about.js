        Back in high school, after finishing my 12th grade and looking for
        something to do during a long summer break, I decided to try my hand at
        building a website. That project sparked a passion for web development
        that has only grown stronger over the years. Fast forward to Today, I
        take pride in developing web solutions that are not only visually
        appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.

        These days, I'm really diving deep into <span> Machine Learning </span>{" "}
        , <span> Artificial Intelligence </span>, and
        <span> Generative AI. </span> It's like unlocking a whole new world of
        possibilities! I'm fascinated by how these technologies can predict
        outcomes, understand languages, and even create new content out of thin
        air.

        When Iâ€™m not geeking out over tech stuff, you can usually find me
        playing or watching cricket, which is my favourite way to unwind. I also
        love listening to music, which keeps me inspired and energised.

        Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about me. Let's connect and create
        something amazing together!
